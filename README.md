# Assignment 3: Functions & Modules in Python

This repository contains Python programs for **Module 4: Functions & Modules**, focusing on defining functions and utilizing built-in modules like `math`.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.


## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `math` module to calculate:
   - The square root of the number
   - The natural logarithm (log base e)
   - The sine of the number (interpreted in radians)
3. Displays all calculated values to the user.
